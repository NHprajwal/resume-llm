Summary

An ambitious teenager with big dreams and ideas, I’ve gotten myself in quite a few scenarios. I’m 17 and all my life I've dreamed of
owning supercars and hypercars but most importantly inspiring people to change for the better and making people laugh, it’s a trait
of mine that some would call a talent. Back in October on the 19th of 2019, I had a vision to create the best mobile detailing business
in Arizona, with a comedic twist of course. Hence came the name “3 Bros and A Hose,” and believe me I've gotten quite a few funny
reactions out of that name. Fast forward a few months and I've been able to detail supercars, work on American muscle cars and I've
received numerous 5 star ratings from a multitude of customers, many of which I’ve become friends with and some who have
become my mentors. I've travelled quite a bit as well, I was given the opportunity to be able to live In Nice, France when I was 5 and I
learned a lot about people when I lived there, my experiences there even prompted me to learn French which I’m now close to
conversationally fluent in. Apart from living in France I’ve been able to travel to many places in both America and Europe and meet a
multitude of people, might I add that I’m incredibly grateful that I’ve been given these opportunities and I’m more than grateful to
say that I've learned many lessons from many people. The reason that I believe I’d be an excellent fit for Scottsdale Maserati and
Ferrari is that I can add team building skills, promote and uphold a positive and welcoming environment, promote the extensive
supercar and luxury car inventory, providing excellent detailing services for the vehicles on the lot, bringing in excellent leadership
skills (I was the leader of numerous basketball, tennis and soccer teams and I still participate and lead my tennis team at Desert
Mountain high school). I can also bring a comedic side to the seriousness of things so to speak. Another reason that I'd love to work
for you bis because of my extensive history of automotive detailing. As I stated prior 1 own my own mobile detailing business under
the name of 3 Bros and A Hose, I've worked on a number of cars, ranging from daily drivers all the way up to supercars such as
Lamborghinis and luxury cars such as Mercedes G-Wagons. My greatest strengths would have to be personality, commitment to
whatever job I'm doing and attention to detail, even simply person to person contact I have a very keen eye when it comes to

attention to detail. Thank you for considering me for the position and I look forward to talking with you soon, cheers!
