SUMMARY

A hardworking, sincere and focused professional who has had the opportunity to delve into many
industries ranging from advertising, logistics, travel as well as the World Wide Web. Have a curious nature
and am drawn to positions where | am encouraged to participate in the creation of new ideas, concepts
and encouraged to push boundaries. Always interested in figuring out how to make things work better,
communicate better and ultimately function not only efficiently but exceed expectations. Work well
independently as well as a team player with leadership qualities. These combined traits have served me
