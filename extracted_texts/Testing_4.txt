¢ Tool Used: JMeter, Manual Testing
¢ Description: This was a centralized application on Windows xp for loan department of bank, which caters to all type of loan
requests, and after processing stores complete information. In first phase enter loan application and applicant detail except
contract creation. After approval a contract is created with applicant and guarantor. Manual Testing of this application involved
functional testing, UI testing, regression testing as a Black Box tester. Performance testing was done using JMeter.
¢ Responsibilities :
¢ Requirement AnalysisTest condition and test case preparation
¢ Tested all modules for negative testing as well
e Test case execution ManuallyTested the application for 1000 users using JMeter.
¢ Defect and Issue reporting
