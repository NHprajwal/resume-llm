Data Science Consultant

Deloitte — New York, IL

o Created a recommendation engine for an educational Startup with job descriptions from Indeed, Glassdoor and
LinkedIn using content-based filtering methods, reaching more than 200 users when writing their resume

o Using python libraries pre-processed and cleaned more than 1 million records of sentences to build a MongoDB
database: resulting in 30% reduction in preprocessing

o Applied DistillBert to generate contextual word embeddings for job description and the sentences, which lead to 60%
improvement in speed when compared against BERT, while retaining 97% of the semantic capacities of BERT

o Successfully filtered correct sentences for each missing skill in a resume with cosine similarity score range of 0.87 to
0.98

o Converted sentences into their past tense using pyinflect NLP library in Spacy and achieved 80% grammatical
accuracy using gingerit

o Collaborated with team members within an agile framework for increased efficiency

- Twitter Image Extraction

o Designed an algorithm for a digital marketing company that leverages the power of Tweets to achieve marketing, and
branding goals for their clients; increased ROI by 45%

o Built and automated a pipeline using twitter API tweepy to extract tweets, location, images, and videos from twitter
based on a particular hashtag: a 50% rise in tweepy performance by error identification, debugging and filtering

o Launched an AWS RDS database for storing the scraped twitter information in form a table using PostgreSQL

o Deployed the algorithm on the AWS server using $3 bucket triggered lambda function which would run the python
script to collect information on a requested hashtag

Analytical Chemist
Covance — Redmond, WA
e Created analytic reports leveraging advanced statistical methods, organized and managed other analytic work in the
department (managed data, data ingestion and analysis, delivery of results to senior managers and supervisors,
managed junior team members)
e Instructed Undergrad Lab Technicians on laboratory instrumentation operation and chemical preparation
¢ Designed and presented safety training programs to researchers, students, visiting scholars, and technical staff
¢ Demonstrated how to prepare solutions, calibrate instruments, resolve issues, and maintain chemical inventories
e Inspected and confirmed equipment in the undergrad teaching chemical engineering lab was properly calibrated

Geochemistry Data Analyst
Activation Laboraties — City, STATE
e Built compelling data stories and visualizations to influence decision makers.
e Applied data reduction and exploratory analysis techniques to manage large amounts of data.
e Interpreted and analyzed data using exploratory mathematic and statistical techniques based on scientific methods.
¢ Produced in-depth analyses and proposed solutions to meet complex business needs.
e Applied mathematical techniques to solve complex problems and develop quantitative based assessments.
e Partnered with functional teams to evaluate new data sources and advise on data format and data dictionary.
e Identified data anomalies and worked with business units to perform root cause analysis and resolve issues.
¢ Collaborated with other scientists, ML engineers and program managers to execute data science roadmap.
e Created quarterly plans centered on meeting short- and long-term objectives by maximizing impact and
coordinating tests in collaboration with stakeholders.
e Cleaned and manipulated raw data.
e Used statistical software to analyze and process large data sets.
¢ Developed new functions and applications to conduct analyses.
e Created graphs and charts detailing data analysis results.
- Conducted trace elemental analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for environmental samples
- Performed acid digestion using HF for soil, sediments, and sludges for complete dissolution of the analytes into
solution and ensured perfect accuracy and execution as mistakes could cause serious harm
- Performed lab procedures such as automated titration to examine iron oxide content in rock and soil samples
- Leveraged visual basis macros to calculate the trace metals concentration by considering external calibration
standards, internal standard and matrix interference
- Interpreted environmental data including control charts and range ratios according to company’s standard operating
procedures and quality control guidelines
- Evaluated non-conformance reports by identifying root cause and applying corrective actions
