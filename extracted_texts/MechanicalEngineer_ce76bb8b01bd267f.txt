Summary

Mechanical Engineer with strong experience leading and working in multidisciplinary teams to oversee the design
and procurement of critical equipment in the petrochemical field. In my time at Current Company, I have delivered
over $4 million in cost savings while improving project schedule, safety, and system reliability,

Experience
Mechanical Engineer Program Lead June/2018 — Current
Large Petrochemical Company Location
® Asan Associate Engineer, Mechanical Engineering Lead, and finally a Mechanical Program Lead,
led a cross-functional team of hardware engineers and worked with vendors to develop a scalable
and modular system for Company's $220 Million Flare Gas Recovery Program,
e@ This system design and program approach delivered over $3 million in cost savings while
improving program schedule, safety, reliability, operability, and operating costs.
@ Collaborated with project team and SMEs to develop a solution to condense 9 Ib/hr of MCB vapor
in a new plant using a small chiller, Overall, we reduced flaring, climinated $250k in vessel jackets,
and kept to the original project schedule by keeping the existing air permit.
e@ Working as the primary point of contact, built project plan and managed the internal review and
design process for rotating equipment, Received strong commendations for overall performance,
e@ After analyzing our mechanical spec development work process, independently built set of spec
tools in Excel using VBA that saves —100 hours of work per user, per year, for department of ~75.

Research Assistant & Master's Thesis May/2016 — May/2018
School Robotics Lab Location

®@ Developed control system and built test bench for prototype robotic variable stiffness actuator using
MATLAB, Vicon, and C++. Published work in MDPI Actuators journal and in Thesis.

Senior Design Project Jan/2016 ~ Dec 2016
Local Feed Mill Location

@ Spearheaded project to design, analyze and build a semi-automated sack closing conveyor system
that reduced operating labor by 33%, doubled production speed, and cut operating costs by 20%.
