Dear Head of Recruitment,
As a Software Developer with 3 years of experience in Blockchain, I apply with enthusiasm for this position.

I am currently a Software Engineer: Blockchain at 7PH Technologies, where my role mirrors your
requirements. In particular, I:

e Develop emerging technologies such as Blockchain, AI, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics
e Design and refine solutions to secure client systems and improve key management systems
e Am the Subject Matter Expert for resolving bottlenecks/bugs and devising solutions to mitigate such issues

In addition to my professional experience, I hold a Master of Computer Science. I have strong experience in
developing large-scale concurrent, event-driven distributed systems, as well as working on public key
cryptography/blockchain. Alongside JavaScript, Go and C++, I possess excellent CS fundamentals, including

I have loved every minute of my time at 7PH. As they are relocating to Chicago, I am now seeking a stimulating
opportunity closer to home.
