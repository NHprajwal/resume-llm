Work History

Digital Media Specialist, 09/2013 to 11/2016
Garver — Fort Worth, TX

As a digital media specialist, I developed smart, strategic, and creative solutions that were on-brand and digital oriented. I articulated

ideas and communicated proactively with my Creative Director to determine visual style and conceptual direction.

I created and produced promotional product videos and digital signage using motion graphics, design elements assets and audio/
video editing. Many times, myself taking the lead/initiative in the design/implementation of these assets.

In addition, I developed HTML5 websites and microsites in tandem with the product videos I created to support product awareness
and sales online. I also developed websites for celebrity product ambassadors to support their initiatives, but also as another avenue
to sell product.

I also built multiple Facebook Ad campaigns, creating audiences /ad sets, designing the creatives, bidding for objectives, budgeting
the spend and executing the campaigns as well.

Multimedia Designer-Audio/Video Editor, 03/2008 to 07/2013
The Karma Consortium — City, STATE

As a multimedia designer, I created user experiences (mobile apps) on iPhone 4 (iOS 4) with the Ministry of Tourism of Uganda and
Jim Beam Distillery being two companies I designed apps for using Xcode 4.

I also designed/implemented interactive pdfs for catalogs, gift books and special events. I utilized custom, fully functional QR codes
with company branding for use in promotional efforts.

I created/designed websites, created motion graphics packages, complete with audio editing/video editing.

Music Publishing Coordinator, 10/2005 to 10/2008
Edmonds Entertainment — City, STATE

I organized, cataloged, maintained and administered the Music Publishing catalog for Edmonds Entertainment in Hollywood. I was
responsible for finding the right cues for each scene, logging each scene, editing in temp music, sending back to my Music Supervisor

for approval.

Once approved, I replaced temp music with tagged music from our library, assigned PRO's/writer-producer credits, and sent finals
to editors for placement. I also worked in the field as a PA on location for a few series, as well as logging shows. I gained a wealth of

knowledge about reality TV production, music publishing, and budgeting as a whole.
