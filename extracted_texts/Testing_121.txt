PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

For the past 28 years, I have been blessed to wake up each day and go to a job where I am able to change lives. Having a part in helping mold
a young person's future is a a chance that not many are given and I have been fortunate in my career to work with students of all ages,
ethnicities, abilities and personalities. After 14 years in the classroom, I was given the opportunity at a leadership role and found that I also
enjoy working with adults. Not only have I been able help students reach their full potential, but I have been able to use my experience in the
classroom to mentor teachers and other paraprofessionals. I have found that it is crucial to identify the individual needs of students and adults
alike so that they have positive experiences with a goal of becoming self motivated and a chance to become successful in whatever they
choose to do. My current role in education has allowed me to continue to build relationships between students, their parents, the school and
our community. It is this connection that gives way to everyone understanding the culture that surrounds us and the desire to make a
difference in a positive way. It is my goal to touch as many young people and adults as I can and serve as a role model for life long learning.
