ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Languages: We include these if you are bilingual or multilingual

Community involvement: Do you volunteer, help coach the local sports team? Telling potential employers
how you spend time outside of work can often help build rapport

Licenses: We include these if you have them and/or the job requires them

Interests: We like to include your authentic interests. Things like reviewing movies on a
blog, climbing Mount Everest, deep sea fishing or travelling around Australia in a
campervan are all more engaging than your typical reading and watching movies.
