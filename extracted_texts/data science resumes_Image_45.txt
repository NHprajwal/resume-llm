PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Data Scientist Intern, MasterCard Inc. San Carlos, CA 6/2015 - 12/2015(expected)

Independently designed the automatic anomalies detection system for business metrics time series data

e Researched on anomaly detection algorithm and finally choose the S-H-ESD test from Twitter as basic logic

e Read package source code of R and re-organized the logic and input to fit the business metncs data application scenario,
with integrating special requirement from business and engineer staff's execution

e Used Impala/SQL for ETL the data from production, complied the R code into mapper and reducer function in Python
with each group id as mapper key, and set up the map-reduce data pipeline job on Oozie

e Build PPT for presentation and interactive dashboard from Shiny for collecting feedback of the algorithm to team and
quick response to additional need from business and engineer colleagues

Collaborative tasks from other projects

e Helped to write mapper and reducer function on word count for merchant classification based on transection records

e Build Hadoop cluster of 12 nodes including tuning critical parameters, and was responsible for the maintenance on
memory usage and related package installation under CentOS6.5 Linux environment

e Participated in the Cloudera training on Apache Spark

Tech-Sale Analytics Intern, Anheuser-Busch Inbev, Champaign, IL 5/2014 -5/2015

Customer profiling with social media data source and internal wholesaler database

Learned the original algorithm and created advanced string cleaning step for Foursquare/Yelp database

Improved the whole workflow by adding lat/lon information as well as innovative filters to increase mapping accuracy
Wrote and integrated all steps in pipelined R code for future usage and cooperated with 3" party to build dashboard
Overeame the challenges of handling Asian languages and popularized the customer profiling project to global market

Mentored new interns for taking over the customer profiling work flow

Quantitative exploration experiment projects (Ad Hoc)

e = Predicted volume for each POC through logistic models and learning algorithms, identified the influencing POCs
e Used regression tree to predict the number of pipe needed by the target volume for Belgium on-premise market

e ‘Transfer the data analysis result to commercial insight and presented to business managers on a regular basis
