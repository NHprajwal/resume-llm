Technical Lead, 2006 - 2012
Advance Health Media — City, STATE
* Technical lead in charge of client websites, web services, and data exchanges for one of the company’s largest clients and also one of the
top five pharmaceutical companies in the world based on revenue, consisting of around one hundred twenty thousand employees. Services
provided include but are not limited to; one main portal site used by client representatives for meeting planning/requests reports provided
using XSLT and SQL Reporting Services reports, the ability to manage budget, and allows the reps to view and track their meetings. The
meeting planning portal also includes third-party login for the client’s vendors to use the site to perform their planning services and a web
service that allows client vendors to also plan meetings in the application via the back end. There is a secondary site used by the client's
customers for viewing, electronically signing, and historical tracking of contracts in PDF format also using SSRS. There is a nightly data
exchange between these sites and the client consisting of forty-five scheduled SQL Agent jobs, seventeen of which are calling SSIS
packages and the rest are calling legacy DTS packages. The data exchange updates internal system data via imports that massage, scrub,
detect discrepancies, and cache imported data. The data exchange in addition exports client data in the form of reports the client has
requested to keep their systems up to date with company-managed data.
e Provide Rough Order of Magnitudes (ROMS) for new development to operations based on client ideas

Manage a team of developers from initially assigning out projects, meeting to discuss implementation and questions, to code review and

QA push back to final production deployment and project completion.

* Configuration management including creating release folders in Subversion. Merging developer check-ins that have passed code review
into the QA environment. Copying finalized QA Subversion folders to staging environments upon sign off and finally pushing staged
folders to the live production environment as both scheduled deployments and hotfixes. Deployments also include pushing any SQL
scripts, procedures and other database objects or updates needed by the projects going to the appropriate environments.

e Maintaining a stable production environment by routinely checking for site errors and implementing hotfixes when they arise. This often

includes SQL tuning/optimizing slow procedures or functions, fixing code, rebuilding indexes, and occasional data cleanup that results in

foreign key or index constraint errors.

Provide regular updates to upper account management on developer project progress, current initiatives, and database ad-hoc extracts, and
answer any technical or business rule-related questions they may have from the client.
