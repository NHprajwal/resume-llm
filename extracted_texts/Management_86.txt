Current to Current "Bubbly" Joyful Personality
"Bubbly" Joyful Personality
I have a very outgoing, optimistic personality which I think would be great for serving customers. I never fail to put a
smile on a persons face during conversation. I also never let my personal life interfere with my professional life,
allowing me to always get the job done with a smile on my face.

Current to Current Professional and Determined Attitude
Professional And Determined Attitude
Many people often tend to get off task, allowing them to forget about what their main goal work is, to serve every
customer in a timely fashion with a possitive attitude. I think that having a professional attitude towards your job, while
still remaining welcoming and positive is the number one priority in any Food or Beverage industry, and I am sure I
have what it takes to do exactly that.
