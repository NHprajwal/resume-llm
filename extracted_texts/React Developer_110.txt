I got this job as a part-time internship with CPT application. Badger Innovations is a start-up company designing and
developing websites for small businesses. During the intern period I joined a developing team, working together with
developers to finish 3 complete websites. My proficiency in HTML and CSS significantly speed up the work flow of
our team. I learned a lot about javaScript developing tricks, especially Ajax. I also got more experience about server-
side scripts like PHP. This internship helped me understanding better about the needs and thoughts of the clients, and
team working with other developers. I consider this internship a valuable experience in my career.

end functionality using Javascript. I also worked with other developers on synchronizing data between the application
