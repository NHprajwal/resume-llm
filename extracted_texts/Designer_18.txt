PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Creative, unconventional, and introspective individual driven with the lifelong goal of trying to answer the questions: “What/who are we
humans,” and “What is life?” Soft skills acquired from introspection and the practice of empathy include tenacity, mental toughness, detail
orientation, and social skills. Hard skills acquired through academia (mainly) include a theoretical understanding and to an extent, practical
understanding, of foundational laboratory methods and a well-established understanding of a broad scope of topics under the interdisciplinary
field of neuroscience, including, but not limited to, neuroanatomy, language, sleep, audition, memory and learning, electrophysiology. neural
stem cells, neurological diseases, neurodevelopment, and neuronal cell biology. Quarters of academic and both wet lab and dry lab
involvement have cultivated a more well-rounded individual of science, and nourished a passion and urge for scientific exploration.

EXPERIENCE

Reseach Assistant in Iacoboni Lab, 01/2022 - Current
Ddb — Brooklyn, NY
Aid with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) research:
® participate in hands-on research related to social neuroscience and clinical neuroscience (for example, implicit discrimination and
autism), including but not limited to hardware set up, software manipulation, participant interaction (ie making sure participants are
comfortable, "wiring up" them with electrodes)
® participant recruitment for sessions- posters, social media, word-of-mouth

Reseach Assisstant in Lin Lab, 03/2022 - Current
Effective Altruism — City, STATE
participate in research focused on neurodevelopment:
e Effects of prenatal stress on adult male murine brain and behavior- participated in data collection to determine neurologically "normal"
olfactory behavior
* wrote abstract "Prenatal stress (PNS) promotes adult onset neurogenesis in the ependymal- subventricular zone of adult male
offspring" for SFN 2022, and presenting author for the paper
* asymmetry in the developing (mice) brain: participate in cell staining experiments to determine Nr2f?2 cellular/protein‘mRNA asymmetry
in the adult murine male brain relative to the prenatal brain using techniques of in-situ hybridization, immunohistochemustry, and
microscopic (confocal, fluorescence) analysis
participation in upcoming stem cell research:
* currently performing a literature search on small molecules used for chemical reprogramming (interesting, many of them overlap with
cancer research)
