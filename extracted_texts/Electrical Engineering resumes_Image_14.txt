EXPERIENCE HIGHLIGHTS

MALPAIS SYSTEMS, Des Moines, lowa
Electrical Engineer, 8/2011 - Present
Integral in the design, development, testing of vibration, pressure, force, gas, and inertial sensors,
Create analog, digital, D/A, A/D, and mixed-signal circuit designs as well as electrical specifications
for new system designs. Actively involved in full life design cycle, from requirement definition
through design, prototyping, proof of concept testing, and interface implementation; outline and
develop validation test plans. Co-author @mprehensive suppart documents for Fabrication,
Integrated Circuit (IC) Design, PCB Design, and ASIC Design teams, Interface with internal
customers and external production / mechanical engineering teams.
Sebeted Contributions:
* Saved potentially thousands in production costs by identifying strategic improvements to
product life cycle during the New Product Development (NPD) process.
* Triggered 2.3% increase in sensor reliability by developing testing validation procedures,
* Played key role in ensuring team efforts met—and often exceeded —all financial,
performance, quality, and reliability goals.
