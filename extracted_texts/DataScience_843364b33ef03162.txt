STRENGTHS

Q Not afraid of wrong ideas

Getting it wrong is almost always

part of getting it right. My bad
idea can give you the spark
needed to help us succeed, or
vice versa. We can work better
by helping each other spot flaws
and suggest improvements.

Keen learner

Always learning in order to keep
up-to-date with technology
enhancements. Still in my early
years as a Data scientist and
therefore keen to learn as much
as possible.

Flexible

Fine to work overtime or
complete extra training if
needed.
