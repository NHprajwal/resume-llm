SUMMARY

I have had the unique opportunity not only to be a team leader at ODA for a number of years, but also be mentored over the last two years by a
colleague with over 20 years of leadership at ODA. Through observation and educational growth through course work, I was able to reflect on
my own leadership style from the past and find areas of growth and expertise I can carry back into the role again. My strengths remain in

finding the strengths within my team, growth in curriculum and leadership coursework, collaboration, promoting team growth and development,

student centered and individual collaboration and problem-solving, and providing a balance between being a leader, a mentor, a nurturer, and
colleague. I feel I would most benefit the 7th grade team with my organizational skills as well as creating a balance where individual teachers
enhance the team by bringing their strengths to the team while guiding them through the growth process of teaming together. As a second
female to the team with many years experience as a 7th grade team leader, I feel I bring an added perspective as well as years of ODA core

values.
