© «Project Name: Acted as the lead in a 5S-person team for the design of an amphibious autonomous robot that can
function on land and water. Pertormed the CAD modeling of parts, calculatians, technical writing, and
designed the chassis, suspension, and drive train. Led weekly meetings, liaised with advisors, and ensured

project goals and deadlines were met. Received award for the best Capstone Project of this year

¢ Chassis Systems Design: Led a 4-person team in designing a steering system for a passenger vehicde.
Performed research and feasibility analysis, designed parts and prototype with NX, constructed prototype,
and developed a maintenance manual and presentation.

© «Powertrain Design: Designed a powertrain system for a small pickup truck as part of a person group
Accountable for compiling and editing engineering report, technical calculations, performance evaluation,
and selection of engine and transmission parameters

¢ Air Standard Engine: Designed the parameters for a 4-stroke gasoline engine

¢ Vehicle Dynamics & Control: Simulated effects using CarSin of front and rear suspension characteristics on
handling characteristics at 100 km/h and steering wheel rate of 30 deg/s.

¢ Automotive Structural Design: Performed SSS-based structural analysis to determine the material that would
maximize stiffness and minimize vehicle weight. Developed and presented the findings

¢ Tire Handling Machine: Designed an autonomous robot as part of 8-person team capable of picking up and
placing 3 different size tires from 3 conveyer belts. Performed the CAD modeling, Finite Element analysis,

and full motion simulation using NX, Created engineering documents and wrote the final engineering report
