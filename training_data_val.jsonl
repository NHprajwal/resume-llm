Specifically, I estimate the relationship between the level of firm blockholders and excess returns of the firm using the Fama-French Three-Factor Model and six different group categories of block ownership level. The results of this study indicate that there exists a non-monotonic relationship between blockholders level and firm performance. I find relatively higher performance for firms with moderate levels of blockholders and relatively lower performance for firms with low (or no) blockholders or high level of blockholders. This suggests that there may exist an optimal level of blockholders.

Ambitious Graduate of Sociology and Psychology, with 20 + combined years of experience in communicating important information to adults and children. Taught 5 classes my first semester in a community college. Teachers Assistant to Professor at California State University Bakersfield with emphasis in Grading, Attendance, and Tests. Adept at developing lesson plans. Particularly skilled at getting a class to take a thought a step further. Dedicated to teaching others all I can about a topic, including what may not be covered in a book. Did Teaching Track and Thesis. Six years of teaching experience in classroom environments with preschool, school age, and some high school. Have explained complex contracts and building processes to clients for 17 years. I was one of the top students of all time giving my teaching presentation. Skills  Detailed instruction e Student engagement e Lesson planning  Active listening skills  Quizzes, tests and exams e Classroom management Experience Professor of Behavioral Science, 08/2018 to Current Purdue University  Dubois, IN I was thrilled to teach 5 Sociology classes my first semester at Bakersfield College. I improved students critical thinking and writing abilities dramatically by having weekly and twice weekly writing assignments where I proofread for accuracy of concepts, critical thinking skills, sentence structure, punctuation, grammar, and citation. I would also challenge people to think about alternatives to what they wrote about. Another technique I used was having students rewrite papers to make them better. Students took their assignments more seriously. Writing improved. Critical thinking also improved. Students also did a term paper on a particularly relevant social issue. I implemented regular tests and quizzes along with a pop quiz towards the end of the semester. The first quiz however, was designed as an assessment to see where the students needed help. This was a fabulous tool to help gauge what my students needed help in. This was when I discovered that many of my students needed help in their writing and expressive abilities. I also focused on increasing students capacity for memorization by having them develop and use flash cards. I also had them form and participate in study groups during class time. This was to show them that if they studied then their test scores would improve...and indeed they did! I also required the students to practice their verbal skills by reading aloud excerpts from the book and the power point presentations, as well as their own material from different required assignments. To emphasize working collaboratively (because many of todays work places have a high degree of collaboration) I had the students form into groups and do a research paper, a poster board, in class assignments and group presentations on various topics. My idea is to get the students to not only master concepts and to think critically, but to help them develop a proficiency and mastery of written communication, and oral communication. The improvements have been miraculous. I have taken students who can barely write, (I have a lot of English as a second, third, or fourth language learners) and not only worked with them but also found the resources that helped them improve in these critical areas. I had asked the writing and tutoring centers to present to my classes so that the students would become familiar with what those centers offered. I also had the students fill-out cards of times that they would go to those centers to get help. Another technique that I used was to assign the A students with students getting lower grades. I did not tell them that this was what I was doing, as it seemed as if I was randomly assigning people into groups. I had asked each group to discuss how much time you spend studying, what your study habits are, and then to quiz each other on some of the material. I did this to let the lower grade students know that people who tend to get better grades take more time to do their work and to study. For a student who showed mastery of the material, but were unable to do well on written tests because of test anxiety, I asked questions and would take their answers orally. A few other students were hospitalized or who where in the process of losing a family member and could not attend class. I did an online form of class with them.

Jimmy worked as an intern this past summer at National Securities in our Investment Banking Group. I run the Healthcare Investment Banking practice and worked with Jimmy closely. In the 26 years I have spent in banking I have worked with, managed and mentored many young bankers. I am a graduate of Columbia University and received my MBA in Finance from the Wharton School. I began my career in Merrill Lynchs Mergers and Acquisitions Group, and with roles of increasing responsibilities, led the Global Healthcare M&A practices of UBS, Robertson Stephens, and Wells Fargo. Afterwards, I ran the Global Healthcare Investment Banking practice SUMMARY OF SKILLS e Guest services  Loss prevention  Inventory control procedures  Cash register operations e Merchandising expertise  Product promotions ACCOMPLISHMENTS e at Unterberg, Towbin.  Most of the banking analysts I have worked with have either graduated from college or were spending the summer before graduation as an intern.  Jimmy was a junior and had little experience in banking. e Working for a number of senior bankers, Jimmy was asked to perform a variety of different analyses.  Most entailed having to utilize corporate websites, financial statements, and database services such as CapitalIQ to complete his assignments. e He quickly mastered the use of these databases and was mature and confident enough to seek clarification of issues he did not understand or were unclear.  His output was well thought out, detail oriented and showed that he had understood the purpose of the analyses he was being asked to perform. e In addition, he was successfully able to manage the politics of working for numerous senior bankers. e He quickly made himself a part of the team and was well-liked and respected by everyone. e His dedication and commitment were evident throughout the summer and we were all sad to see his internship end.  I would give Jimmy my strongest recommendation and I have no doubt he will succeed in any endeavor he pursues.  Regards, Hany Awadalla 410 Park Avenue, 14th Floor New York, NY 10022.

I love new technologies and I love learning about them. I have been modding video games almost as long as Ive been playing them, and I am no stranger to dissecting processes I dont yet understand. I have been an employee of Nike for 13 years, and my journey in this awesome company has continually led me closer to the things that I truly enjoy. In my personal time over the years, Ive learned programs like Photoshop, 3DS Max, After Effects, and Premier - to create custom content for games and produce high quality imagery/videos to communicate the content to consumers. In my professional time, Ive learned 3D modeling, materializing and rendering - to create high quality representations of footwear concepts for design gates and presentations. I am a fast learner, I have a lot of relevant experience, and I am so excited about the opportunity to take part in Immersive Technologies. Between my program proficiencies and my demonstrated ability to adapt to new processes, I believe that I would be a valuable asset to the Immersive Team as they blaze a new trail for Nike. SKILLS e 13 years of experience in Nike footwear e Familiar with publishing 3D models for Augmented Reality e Expert in Photoshop and image composition e Familiar with project creation, in-engine material creation, version e Experienced in Maya, Modo, Magics, ZBrush, Substance Suite, control, model/material import, and basic rendering/animating in After Effects, Adobe Premier, and Illustrator Unreal e Experienced in 3D model creation, rendering, and exporting forRP  Complex understanding of lighting scenes, managing reflections printing, or use in apps like Unreal, Marmoset, Colorway, and and color, and exploring a 3D space with a lens Substance  Real-Time pipeline familiarity EXPERIENCE 3D Designer 1, 05/2018 - Current Nike  City, STATE In 2018, I was promoted to 3D Designer 1. VS support had reached the end of its life span and I committed my time wholly to 3D and DPC. I was assigned as support to GFB and continued previous 3D duties, as well as starting in-line modeling for design gates. After publishing 5 GFB shoes to Unreal for our first all-digital SL, I helped lay out the pipeline and learnings for our second all-digital SL, learning a huge amount about things that run the gamut in our profession - file management and naming, texture map baking, version control, Unreal project creation/ management, real time material creation, modeling and UVing best practices, and more. Relatively recently, I was reassigned to the Womens category, where I continued all previous duties, including exploration of new creative exercises and some fun photoshop mashups of rendered models on Instagram influencers. 3D Production Designer, 05/2017 - 05/2018 Nike  City, STATE In 2017, I was promoted to 3D Production Designer, which included all previous responsibilities and incorporated more help for the CMG/ Pegasus team in their footwear model creation and updating. I became partial support for the CMG team and helped prepare created footwear models for the CMG app, following modeling standards and program limitations to produce fast, high quality renders. I also began taking on more projects for categories -making multiple models, RP parts, and renders for Sketch Reviews, Design Reviews, and Creative Launch. During this time, I also expanded my learning to Modo and adapted my modeling process to a new program. I began testing Nike made scripts and plug-ins, as well as outside programs like Colorway for utilizing created models for color and material application. Digital Artist/Image Editor, 01/2008 - 05/2017 Nike  City, STATE I was responsible for processing and publishing 2D footwear imagery to VS - a color and materials design tool. By the end of 2015, we had branched out to full head to toe imagery, flyknit lay-flats, retail storefront visualization, and equipment. I was also responsible for creating material and color palettes for VS, and accurately matching them to reality. In 2015 I was promoted to Digital Artist and began taking on 3D modeling projects in addition to my responsibilities to VS. I taught myself polygonal modeling in Maya (with a lot of help from peers), became familiar with programs like ZBrush, Cinema 4D, and Magics to make materials and textures, complex parts, and air-tight models for printing. I provided modeling support and testing for CMG, materials creation in Vizoo and X-Rite, and support for pipelines involving the potential production of 3D footwear models.
